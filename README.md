# cars

**Tasks**
- Load data, check correctness, missing values, data types.
- Create a new feature - car brand (company). Which manufacturers' machines are found in the dataset? Next, correct the names and test the changes.
- Leave only part of the predictors, and then calculate the correlation between price and other variables.
- Transform categorical variables with pd.get_dummies().
- Build a model with one price predictor, horsepower. What percentage of variability does the resulting model explain? (\(R^2\))
- Next - two models (with all predictors and with all, except for car brands). Notice the changes in \(R^2\), coefficients and their significance. Which model is best left?
